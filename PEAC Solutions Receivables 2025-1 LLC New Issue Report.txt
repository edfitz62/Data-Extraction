Marlin Leasing Corporation was originally founded as a small ticket independent equipment leasing company in 1997. During  
July 2022, Marlin Leasing Corporation elected to rebrand as Marlin Leasing Corporation d/b/a PEAC Solutions (PEAC Solutions  
or the Company), to align with the family of finance companies acquired by HPS Investment Partners, LLC, including PEAC UK  
and PEAC Europe. PEAC 2025-1 represents PEAC Solutions’ 15th equipment ABS. The Company is a nationwide provider of  
commercial lending solutions, and services small and mid-size businesses. The Company’s products and services include loans  
and leases for the acquisition of mission critical commercial equipment as well as working capital loans. The Company will offer  
equipment loans and leases and working capital loans generally between $250,000 and $5 million, respectively, for any single  
loan or lease. PEAC Solutions entered into a forward flow agreement with Xerox Corporation (Xerox) and its captive financing  
unit in December 2022. Since January 2024, PEAC Solutions also acts as Xerox’s exclusive origination and servicing partner for  
Xerox’s  dealer owned  indirect originations.  PEAC Solutions  has purchased approximately $1.70  billion in Xerox receivables  
through November 2024. PEAC 2025-1 represents the third PEAC Solutions equipment ABS to include Xerox receivables.  
  

The aggregate securitization value (ASV) represents the discounted value of the projected cash flows of the contracts included  
in the collateral pool using a discount rate based on the interest rate on the notes plus fees and other amounts for the lease and  
loan contracts, as well as using the contracts’ rate for the working capital loans. As of December 31, 2024, based on a statistical  
discount rate of 7.00% for the  leases and loans, the aggregate securitization value (Cut-off ASV)  is  approximately $766.07  
million. As of December 31, 2024, based on the final discount rate of 6.75% for the leases and loans, the aggregate securitization  
value is $769.63 million. The Cut-off ASV will include cashflows from three types of receivables: small ticket equipment contracts  
originated by PEAC Solutions (Equipment Receivables) (49.24%), equipment contracts financing small- to mid- ticket equipment  
originated or acquired by Xerox and purchased by PEAC Solutions (Xerox Equipment Receivables) (46.10%) and working capital  
loans (Working Capital  Receivables) (4.66%). The contracts are “hell or high water” obligations without ongoing performance  
obligations of the lessors.  
  

PEAC 2025-1 will issue five  classes of notes, including a short-term tranche. Credit enhancement includes excess spread, a  
reserve account, overcollateralization and subordination  (except for Class C Notes). The overcollateralization is subject to a  
target equal to 14.00% of the current ASV and a floor equal to 1.00% of the initial ASV. The reserve account is funded at 0.50%  
of the initial ASV and is non-amortizing.

  Key Credit Considerations                                                                                                                         +/-  

  Operating History/Experienced Management  
  PEAC Solutions (including as Marlin Leasing Corporation) has originated and serviced small-ticket  
  equipment loans and leases since 1997  and working capital loans since 2015. The management  
 team averages over 20 years of experience in equipment finance either at PEAC Solutions or other  
  large players in the industry including De Lage Landen and CIT.   
                                                                                                                                                      +  
  PEAC Solutions (including as Marlin Leasing Corporation) has been a successful servicer of 14 prior  
  equipment ABS transactions; of these, 11 have fully repaid and three are currently outstanding.  
 The Company  issued  ten equipment ABS  transactions  through February 2010  and then did not  
                                          th 
  issue again until 2018. The 11   ABS, Marlin Receivables 2018-1 LLC, is the most recent transaction  
 to payoff. It fully repaid in December 2021 with lifetime cumulative net losses (CNL) of 3.33% of  
 the original pool balance.  

  Collateral Characteristics  
 The  transaction  benefits  from  diversification  by  obligor  and  geography. The  top  one  and  five  
  obligors are 0.45% and 1.60%, respectively, of the Cut-off ASV. The largest states are California  
  (14.30%) and Texas (11.37%) and all other states are less than 10.00%.  
                                                                                                                                                      +  
 The Xerox Equipment Receivables (46.10% of the Cut-off ASV) have historically exhibited lower  
  losses as compared to Equipment Receivables.   
   
  See Collateral Analysis to view the characteristics of the Cut-off ASV.  

  Integration of Origination/Servicing for Xerox Receivables  
  PEAC Solutions has been purchasing Xerox contracts since 2022 and in January 2024 became the  
  servicer and exclusive funding partner for Xerox’s dealer owned indirect originations and will be  
 the servicer for all of the contracts in PEAC 2025-1. However, the servicing and originations process  
 for the Xerox Equipment Receivables is currently in a transition process under which PEAC Solutions                                                  -  
  services the Xerox originated receivables using Xerox’s systems but will transition to servicing on  
  PEAC  Solutions’  systems. This  transition  is  expected  to  be  complete  by  March  2025.  KBRA’s  
  analysis considers potential transition impacts on the performance of the receivables. See Cashflow  
 Analysis.  

 Transaction Structure  
 The credit enhancement levels in the transaction are sufficient to cover KBRA’s stressed cash flow  
  assumptions  for  each  class  under  the  corresponding  stress  levels  for  that  class.   Credit  
  enhancement consists of overcollateralization, excess spread, a reserve account and subordination  
  (except for Class C Notes).  
   
  Overcollateralization:  At  closing  the  overcollateralization  will  be  approximately  10.70%  of  the  
  $769.63  million  initial ASV. On each monthly payment date collections will be used to reduce  
  outstanding principal on the most senior class of notes until the overcollateralization  reaches its  
 target level of  14.00% of the current ASV. Once this level is attained, the overcollateralization is  
  permitted to amortize to a floor level of 1.00% of the initial ASV.                                                                                 +  
   
  Excess  Spread:  The  transaction  contains  excess  spread,  which  results  from  the  excess  of  the  
  contract yield over the weighted average interest rate on the notes plus transaction expenses. The  
  discount rate of 6.75%, for the equipment loans and leases, plus the weighted average contract  
  rates for the working capital loans,  as compared to the note rate plus servicing fees results in  
  approximately 1.14% per year in initial excess spread available to cover losses.  
   
  Reserve Account:  At closing a reserve account will be funded with  an amount equal to  0.50%  
  (approximately $3.85  million) of the ASV. The reserve account is non-amortizing and therefore  
  grows as a percentage of the current ASV as the pool amortizes.   

  Back-up Servicer  
  U.S.  Bank  National  Association  will  be  the  back-up  servicer.  The  back-up  servicer  receives  a  
  monthly data tape from PEAC Solutions. In the event that PEAC Solutions is terminated as servicer,                                                  +

 Key Changes From PEAC 2024-2  
This section summarizes Company updates and collateral and structural changes since  PEAC 2024-2.  
  

  Company                                        PEAC Solutions has more than $3.4 billion of annual originations across 13 countries  and  
                                                 continues to be wholly-owned by HPS.  HPS is a global private investment firm founded in  
                                                 2007 with approximately $148 billion of assets under management as of September 2024.   
                                                   
                                                 As  of  November  30,  2024,  PEAC  Solutions  has  acquired  approximately  $1.70  billion  in  
                                                 equipment loans and leases from Xerox.   

  Collateral                                     The primary collateral characteristic changes are summarized below:  
  Characteristics                                  
                                                 ▪      Less  Seasoning:  The weighted average seasoning has  decreased  to seven months  
                                                        from 20 months.   
                                                 ▪      Higher Average Contract Balance: The average contract balance has increased to  
                                                        $21,100 from $14,234 as a result of the lower level of seasoning, which leads to less  
                                                        amortization.   

PEAC 2025-1                                                                                                5                                                                               February  11, 2025  

  
﻿                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  

                                             ▪     Segment  Mix  Changes:  The  majority  of  the  pool  continues  to  be  made  up  of  
                                                   Equipment   Receivables   and   Xerox   Equipment   Receivables,   however   Equipment  
                                                   Receivables are the highest segment concentration up to 49.24% from 48.62% while  
                                                   Xerox Equipment Receivables are down to 46.10% from 50.04% and are no longer the  
                                                   largest segment concentration. Working Capital Receivables  increased to 4.66% from  
                                                   1.34%.  Xerox  Equipment  Receivables  have  historically  exhibited  lower  losses  as  
                                                   compared to Equipment Receivables and Working Capital Receivables.  
                                             ▪     Decreased Residuals: The residuals have decreased to 1.37% from 4.29%.  
                                             ▪     Lower Obligor Concentrations: The obligor concentrations are lower with the top one  
                                                   and  top  five  obligors  decreased  to  0.45%  and  1.60%  from  0.67%  and  2.59%,  
                                                   respectively. This results from the increased percentage of Working Capital Receivables  
                                                   which increases the overall distribution of obligors.  
                                             ▪     Lower Copiers & Printing Equipment Type: The top equipment type continues to be  
                                                   Copiers & Printing  but the concentration decreased to 55.79% from 71.25% resulting  
                                                   from the decreased percentage of Xerox Equipment Receivables that are concentrated  
                                                   in this equipment type, as well as a decreased concentration of Copiers & Printing within  
                                                   the Equipment Receivables.

Servicer Review  
PEAC Solutions provided KBRA with information on the Company and its policies and processes, a summary of which is below.  
  

Company Overview and History  
PEAC Solutions is a member of the PEAC family of finance companies, which also  includes PEAC UK and PEAC Europe. PEAC  
stands for Pan-European Americas Capital Solutions. Collectively, the PEAC family of companies has more than $3.4 billion of  
annual originations across 13 countries and is owned by funds managed by HPS Investment Partners LLC (HPS). HPS is a global  
private investment firm founded in 2007 with approximately $148 billion of assets under management as of September 2024.  
  
PEAC Solutions’ was founded as Marlin Leasing Corporation in 1997 as an independent small ticket commercial finance company.  
In 2003, in anticipation of an initial public offering, Marlin Business Services Corp.  (MBSC) was incorporated, and operations  
were reorganized into a holding company structure by merging Marlin Leasing Corporation with a wholly owned subsidiary of  
MBSC. As a result, all former shareholders of Marlin Leasing Corporation became shareholders of MBSC. The initial public offering  
of common stock of MBSC occurred on November 12, 2003.  
  
On January 20, 2022, MBSC was acquired by funds that are managed by HPS. As a result of that acquisition, MBSC's common  
stock is no longer listed and, instead, MBSC is now wholly owned by Madeira Holdings, LLC. After the acquisition of MBSC, Marlin  
Leasing Corporation remains in existence as MBSC'’s primary operating subsidiary. During July 2022, Marlin Leasing Corporation  
elected to rebrand as Marlin Leasing Corporation d/b/a PEAC Solutions to align with the family of finance companies acquired by  
HPS. In February 2024, PEAC Solutions launched an inventory finance program to provide short-term financing (3-24 months)  
which enables dealers to stock optimal inventory,  and distributors to import equipment for sale. The Company offers  lines  
between $250,000-$5 million. Inventory financing lines are not included in PEAC 2025-1.  
  
Today PEAC Solutions is a nationwide provider of commercial lending solutions and services small and mid-size businesses. The  
Company’s products and services include loans and leases for the acquisition of mission critical commercial equipment as well  
as working capital loans.  Equipment loans and leases and working capital loans generally have a maximum of $5 million and  
$250,000, respectively, for any single loan or lease. PEAC Solutions is headquartered in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, with additional  
offices in Jacksonville, FL, Las Vegas, NV and Philadelphia, PA.   
  

Xerox Partnership  
In December 2022, PEAC Solutions entered into a forward flow agreement with the  captive finance business of Xerox  that  
provides global financing solutions for customer purchases of Xerox equipment, as well as non-captive lease financing to end- 
user customers and provides financing products to multi-line dealers and other vendors. Originations fall into three channels  
across direct and indirect:  
  
▪     Direct: sales made directly from Xerox mostly to large enterprise customers.  
▪     Indirect XBS: sales of Xerox copiers and ancillary items by Xerox-owned dealerships.  
▪     Indirect ADR: sales from independent dealers that market Xerox, other copier brands and related equipment .

As of  November  2024, PEAC  Solutions  has acquired approximately  $1.70  billion in equipment loans and leases  from  
Xerox.  Effective January 2024, PEAC  Solutions  and Xerox  expanded their relationship and  entered into a servicing  
agreement and a transition services agreement  pursuant to which PEAC Solutions services indirect leases retained by  
Xerox  and  leases purchased from Xerox.  Under the expanded relationship,  PEAC Solutions  acts  as Xerox’s exclusive  
origination and servicing partner for all of Xerox’s dealer owned indirect originations. Currently, PEAC solutions services  
the Xerox originated receivables using Xerox’s servicing systems.

Originations are generated through the Company’s network of  over  11,790  active  independent commercial equipment  
dealers, as well as through relationships with brokers and directly with end user customers. As a result of its long history,  
PEAC  Solutions  has  a large base of customers,  with over  60,000 active and over  422,000 lifetime customers.  PEAC  
Solutions describes its originations model as a “fly wheel” in which dealer relationships create leads with end user customers  
and end user customer relationships create leads with additional dealers. The model naturally accelerates growth from all  
channels. Throughout PEAC Solutions’ history, the majority of originations have been equipment finance for a wide range  
of small-ticket equipment. Beginning in 2015, the Company began offering an unsecured working capital loan product.  
Originations of working capital loans were primarily sourced through existing equipment finance borrowers. The mix of  
equipment finance and working capital originations has generally been about 90%/10% on average.  
  
The graph below shows the annual origination volume. The 2024 originations declined approximately 14% compared to  
2023.  The decline was attributable to PEAC Solutions’ expanded relationship with Xerox  in 2023 which resulted in a  
significant  spike  in  originations  from  the  prior  year.  Through  this  relationship,  PEAC  Solutions  purchases  Xerox  
originations through a forward flow agreement and is the exclusive finance provider for Xerox indirect originations. The  
Xerox originations volume in 2023 included  purchases of legacy Xerox originations at the advent of the program, and  
therefore future originations growth were expected to be moderated, but still a significant component of total origination,  
as compared to the change from 2022 to 2023.   Despite the aggregate decline YoY, originations through equipment  
finance and working capital were up 27.0% and 11.6% respectively.  
  

                                                                                                                                                                                        
  

Xerox Contracts Underwriting and Servicing  
  
Direct  
Contracts with Xerox direct customers continue to be originated by Xerox. Under the forward flow agreement, PEAC  
Solutions  can  purchase these originations at its option. The decisioning around pricing of purchases is based on key  
performance indicators developed based on Xerox direct contract performance by risk rating. Xerox direct contracts  
continue to be serviced by Xerox on their systems.  
  
Indirect XBS  
The contracts in this channel are generated through Xerox owned dealers selling Xerox equipment . As the exclusive  
financing partner for indirect originations, PEAC Solutions has the right of first refusal for contracts in this channel. PEAC  
US carries out the underwriting for this channel. The underwriting is based on a calibration of PEAC Solutions’ & Xerox’s  
scoring  systems. The calibration aligned the decisioning framework by  probability of default by calibrating Xerox  risk  
ratings and PEAC Solutions credit risk grade methodologies. Contracts are originated on Xerox approved forms and will  
be funded directly by PEAC Solutions. While servicing of these contracts is carried out by PEAC Solutions employees,  
primarily hired from Xerox, the servicing is carried out using Xerox’s systems. A transition is in progress after which  
servicing will use PEAC Solutions systems.

Indirect ADR  
The contracts  in this channel are generated through independent dealers selling both Xerox and other manufacturers’  
equipment. These originations currently use PEAC Solutions’ underwriting. Documentation is primarily PEAC Solutions  
forms with some approved third party private label documents.  Most of  the servicing for these contracts  uses  PEAC  
Solutions’ standard systems, processes and people. A small portion of contracts from this channel use Xerox systems  
to carry out servicing, however this is being transitioned to PEAC Solutions systems.  
  

Xerox Transition Process  
Following the execution of the agreements in late 2023 under which PEAC  Solutions will service both the Xerox service  
retained and purchased Xerox indirect originations, PEAC  Solutions  commenced a transition process. Immediately after  
execution of the agreements, offers were extended by PEAC Solutions to the Xerox servicing and underwriting staff (40  
US employees) and  all  the employees  accepted  their offers  by January 2024. While the transition process was  being  
implemented,  PEAC  Solutions  employees  were  using  Xerox  systems,  processes,  lockbox,  outsourced  servicing  and  
technology support providers for servicing. The legacy Xerox employees are reporting to PEAC  Solutions supervisors to  
enable continuity and education. PEAC Solutions completed its development phase for the processes and systems for the  
transferred servicing in November 2024. The goal is for transitioned systems and processes to go live by March 2025.  
  
There are various factors that PEAC Solutions management believes will facilitate a smooth transition process:  
▪     A transition committee has been established which meets weekly with key leaders and stakeholders.  
▪     Given that all the legacy Xerox employees accepted their offers, the servicing will be carried out by the same staff.  
▪     PEAC Solutions has been booking and originating indirect ADR originations on its own system since September 2023.  
▪     PEAC Solutions’  outsourced servicing staff was previously performing Xerox servicing and  most of  that staff has  
      been retained by the third party servicer.  
▪     PEAC Solutions and Xerox use the same lease servicing system.  
▪     PEAC Solutions’ managed portfolio of small ticket contracts have been heavily weighted in copier leasing providing  
      institutional knowledge around these types of contracts.  
▪     The Xerox lockbox will remain open for the transition and will reroute misdirected payments.  
▪     US Bank will remain in place as the backup servicer.  
  

PEAC Solutions Underwriting  
  
Dealer Underwriting and Monitoring  
PEAC Solutions’ credit approval process includes underwriting of both its equipment dealer partners as well as obligors. The  
Company has established guidelines to qualify new dealers. Dealer underwriting is based on commercial credit reports, virtual  
or physical site inspection, reviews of manufacturer relationships, confirmation of time in business and equipment type. Dealers  
are monitored monthly and a formal review is completed annually. PEAC Solutions tracks all applications and lease originations  
by dealer and assesses whether the origination source has a high application decline rate and analyzes the portfolio performance  
on the leases and loans originated through that source. PEAC Solutions will place an origination source on watch status if its  
portfolio performance statistics are consistently below expectations. If the origination source's statistics do not improve in a  
timely manner, PEAC Solutions often stops accepting applications from that origination source.  
  
End User Underwriting  
All applicants are scored using PEAC Solutions’ customized scorecards. Key components to the scorecards include bureau scores  
(Paynet, Experian, D&B), industry and state analysis, trade payments, time in business and business size. The underwriting  
process differs based on the dollar amount of exposure with auto approvals permitted in some cases up to $500,000. The flow  
transaction process applies to exposures up to $350,000 (or $500,000 for Construction Transportation & Industrial) and includes  
rule  based  underwriting  guidelines,  PEAC  Solutions  and  bureau  scores  (Paynet,  Experian,  D&B),  bank  statements,  online  
reputational searches and virtual and/or physical site inspections. The mid-ticket process applies to exposures over $350,000  
(or $500,000 for Construction Transportation and Industrial)  and includes the flow process components as well as financial  
statement analysis, industry specific risk acceptance criteria and industry analysis.   
  
Credit personnel use PEAC Solutions’ database and information management tools to monitor the characteristics and attributes  
of the overall portfolio. Reports are produced to analyze origination source performance, end user customer delinquencies,  
portfolio concentrations, trends, and other related indicators of portfolio performance. Any significant findings are presented to  
the risk committee for review and action. Credit underwriting is subject to monitoring by governance risk, compliance teams  
and internal audit to ensure that the credit department adheres to all underwriting guidelines and policies. Management reports  
are regularly generated by these teams and departments detailing the results of these surveillance auditing activities.

PEAC Solutions Servicing  
  
Equipment Finance Servicing  
PEAC  Solutions’  servicing function includes a customer service department that handles customer inquiries, contract  
adjustments, missed first payments and end of lease support. The collection strategy employs a delinquency bucket  
segmentation  approach,  where  certain  collectors  are  assigned  to  accounts  based  on  their  delinquency  status.  The  
delinquency bucket segmentation approach allows PEAC Solutions to assign its more skilled collectors to the later-stage  
delinquent accounts. However, PEAC Solutions does rotate collectors to focus on the highest need areas.  
  
The collection activities typically begin with customer contact when a payment becomes five days past due and continue  
throughout  the  delinquency  period.  PEAC  Solutions  utilizes  a  predictive  dialer  that  automates  outbound  telephone  
dialing. The dialer is primarily used to focus on and reduce the number of accounts that are between 10 and 30 days  
delinquent. A collection notice is normally sent once an account initially falls five days delinquent and then again at 10- 
30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 121 days past due. Collectors input notes directly into a servicing system, enabling the collectors  
to monitor the status of delinquent accounts and promptly take any necessary actions. Scheduled  payments are not  
considered delinquent unless more than 18% of a  scheduled  payment is not paid on its due date. In addition, late  
charges are generally assessed when a customer fails to remit payment on a receivable by its due date.   
  
If the receivable continues to be delinquent, PEAC Solutions may exercise its remedies under the terms of the contract,  
including acceleration of the entire receivable balance, litigation and/or repossession of any related equipment. Accounts  
generally  placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and charged off at  181 days or more past due. At greater  
than 120 days past due, and earlier in some cases such as bankruptcy, refusal to pay or inability to locate the obligor,  
the accounts are referred to PEAC Solutions' internal recovery group, consisting of a team of paralegals and collectors.  
The group utilizes several resources to  maximize recoveries on charged-off accounts, including: (i) initiating litigation  
against the small business customer and any personal guarantor, using outside counsel retained by PEAC Solutions; (ii)  
referring  the  account  to  an  outside  law  firm  or  collection  agency;  and/or  (iii)  repossessing  and  remarketing  the  
equipment through third parties.  
  
Working Capital Servicing  
Working Capital contracts are required to be set up on the Automated Clearing House (ACH) for payments and each  
Working Capital contract has a personal guarantor. ACH rejections are monitored daily and collectors will reach out  if  
the obligor’s payment does not process. The collections process is separated into three delinquency segments: 1 -14  
days past due, 15-29 days past due and 30+ days past due. A collector is assigned to each delinquency segment, with  
escalation of calls and  letters required as the  delinquency advances. Working Capital contracts contain cross default  
language such that any other Equipment contracts with the same obligor would also default if the Working Capital  
contract defaulted. Working Capital contracts are generally charged off at 61 days past due.  
  
Servicing and Operations Augmentation  
While PEAC Solutions maintains complex processing in its US headquarters, the Company has augmented its servicing  
and operations staff through an offshore partner. The team was secured through a business process outsourcing (BPO)  
firm and was previously assigned to servicing Xerox Financial Solutions contracts. Only routine and administrative duties  
are offshored such as flow credit, customer care, early-stage  collections,  accounts  receivable, application entry and  
document generation. The offshore team authenticates into PEAC Solutions’ systems and no data is stored offsite. PEAC  
Solutions’ US supervisors  and managers have continuous oversight  and communications with the offshore team  and  
there are twice a month meetings with PEAC Solutions and BPO leadership.

Managed Portfolio Performance  
  

Delinquency  
The table below shows the managed portfolio delinquency and net loss performance for contracts originated or acquired  
by PEAC Solutions and currently serviced by PEAC Solutions. The Equipment  Receivable delinquencies and net losses  
have generally been consistent, except for the increase in net losses at year end 2020 related to medical contracts,  
specifically dental equipment, as well as the more recent December 2023 increase related to the economic conditions  
of small businesses. Elevated delinquencies and losses have continued into 2024.   
  
The  Working  Capital  delinquencies  have  seen  some  volatility.  At  year  end  2020  there  was  an  increase  related  to  
transportation contracts. The significant  increases in December 2023 were related to an intentional strategy by PEAC  
Solutions to expand these originations through a broker channel (indirect originations). The originations have now been  
brought back to direct across all 50 states leading to improvement in performance, despite delinquencies and losses  
have remained elevated in 2024.

The Xerox  Equipment  losses are much lower than  Equipment  Receivables  and Working Capital, reflecting the higher  
credit quality of the obligors. However, the higher credit quality obligors can exhibit more administrative delinquencies,  
especially at year end.

CNL   
The graphs below show the historical CNLs by vintage year broken out for Xerox purchased receivables, Equipment and  
Working Capital as of the Cut-Off Date. The Xerox purchased receivables CNLs are generally lower than the Equipment  
and  Working  Capital  CNLs.  This  results  from  the  better  obligor  credit  quality.  For  Equipment,  the  vintage  CNL  
performance has been relatively consistent. The higher CNLs in the 2018 and 2019 vintages were related to medical  
equipment contracts (specifically dental) as well as a higher percentage of originations with credit scores of 500-530.  
Originations of these types are lower in more recent vintages. The increased CNLs for the 2022 vintage are related to  
increased stress of macroeconomic factors on small businesses. For Working Capital, the higher 2019 vintage CNLs are  
associated with transportation industry loans. PEAC Solutions scaled back originations of this type in its Working Capital  
product.  The higher 2022 vintage CNLs reflect the intentional expansion of working capital originations through an  
indirect source, which has since been scaled back leading to improved losses.

 KBRA CNL Assumption  
In determining our CNL range for PEAC 2025-1, we reviewed gross and net loss vintage data for each of the three types  
of  receivables  included  in  the  pool:  Equipment,  Xerox  Equipment,  and  Working  Capital.  KBRA  first  determined  a  
cumulative gross loss assumption for each type. Then, the historical vintage data was used to determine a base case  
recovery rate assumption for each type. The data dated back to the 2010 vintage for Equipment and the 2015 vintage  
for Xerox Equipment and Working Capital. The CNL assumption range for the pool represents a weighted average of the  
three individual receivable type CNLs.  
  
In determining the Xerox  Equipment  and  Equipment CNLs, KBRA considered data that  was provided both on a total  
basis and broken out by various characteristics including equipment types, credit scores  and different types of direct  
and indirect originations. KBRA also considered the performance of PEAC Solutions’ prior equipment ABS transactions.  
The Working Capital CNL was based on the historical vintage gross and net loss performance on a total basis. The data  
is not broken out by equipment type segments because the Working Capital collateral is not secured by equipment.   
  
Our base case CNL for the pool is  3.30-3.40%, which is  higher than our CNL range for  PEAC 2024-2. The increase  
reflects the decreased  seasoning of the 2025-1  pool  as well as the change in segment mix. The CNL  differs for each  
rating  because it  is based on the cumulative gross loss assumption reduced for the stressed recovery rate for each  
rating  and  KBRA assumes lower recovery rates for higher rating categories, resulting in higher CNL assumptions for  
higher ratings.

Cashflow Analysis  
KBRA performed cash flow modeling to determine if each class of notes could repay by its legal final maturity date under  
stress assumptions consistent with the ratings. The table below shows KBRA’s stress assumptions for each class. The  
CNL for each class differs slightly because it represents the cumulative gross loss assumption reduced by the stressed  
recovery rate for each class. KBRA applies different stressed recovery rates by rating to reflect more stress on recoveries  
at higher rating categories. KBRA considered a range of stress assumptions for prepayments and loss curves. The table  
shows  the  assumptions  that  resulted  in  the  lowest  coverage  amounts  (i.e.  constraining  runs).  Under  the  stress  
assumptions, each class paid timely interest and principal by its legal final maturity date.  KBRA considered multiples  
above the midpoint of the range  in its Equipment Lease & Loan Global ABS Methodology. The higher multiples reflect  
potential volatility of loss performance related to servicing transition and integration related to the Xerox  Equipment  
Receivables, as well as recent volatility in loss performance for Equipment Receivables and Working Capital Receivables.  
For the Class A-1 Notes, KBRA ran an additional stress scenario to apply a liquidity stress. This scenario assumes no  
losses and no prepayments, and the Class A-1 Notes repay one month prior to their legal final maturity date.

ESG Considerations  
KBRA ratings incorporate relevant credit factors, including those that relate to Environmental, Social, and Governance  
(ESG). The following section highlights ESG considerations that are generally associated with ABS securitizations such  
as  the  subject  transaction.  Transaction-specific  ESG  factors  are  highlighted  below,  where  applicable,  using                                          
Environmental,            Social, and        Governance indicators.  

  Environmental Factors  

            Climate Change and Natural Disasters  
    
            Climate change, natural disasters, and the outbreak of epidemic disease can pose long-term economic risk  
            that can put meaningful and, at times, sudden, pressure on transaction cash flow. Portfolio diversity can help  
            mitigate this risk relative to more concentrated pools. Conversely, high collateral concentration leaves the  
            pool susceptible to adverse economic conditions, changing consumer preferences, regional recessions, and  
            natural disasters, which may negatively affect transaction collections and / or performance. Certain states

             are vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, and hurricanes. The occurrence of such an  
             event  may  cause  reductions  to  transaction  net  cash  flow.  KBRA’s  analytical  process  considers  collateral  
             diversification; for more information, please see the Collateral Analysis section of this report.  
               
             ▪     The pool's largest state exposure is California (14.30%).  
               
             Environmental Laws/Regulations  

             The effects of various environmental laws and regulations may negatively affect the equipment industry. Many  
             aspects of equipment leasing operations, including emissions levels, air, water, solid waste, hazardous and  
             toxic materials, and noise pollution are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations.  
             Regulatory developments could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the equipment  
             industry. KBRA considers how a manager indicates it monitors and responds to such laws and regulations.  
             Please refer to the Originator and Servicer Review section for additional information.  
               
             Equipment ABS transactions may include vehicles, such as trucks, that are subject to emissions standards.  
             When  these  standards  change,  the  recovery  value  of  older,  non-compliant  vehicles  can  be  negatively  
             impacted. KBRA determines base case recovery rates for equipment pools and applies stresses to the base  
             case to ultimately determine a cumulative net loss assumption. The base case recovery rates are determined  
             using historical static pool data, which can be impacted by changing emissions standards for pools that include  
             a material portion of vehicle collateral.   
               

  Social Factors  

             Demographic and Economic Trends  
   
             Changes in demographic trends and the overall direction of the economy can impact consumer preferences,  
   
             affecting the long-term viability of the products and services that drive transaction cash flow. Please see the  
             Originator and Servicer Review section for details.  
               

  Governance Factors  

             Key Transaction Parties  
   
             KBRA considers the capabilities of key parties and their respective affiliates involved in effectuating transaction  
             functions in its analysis, including, but not limited to, the originator, primary servicer, back-up servicer and  
             other parties, as applicable. The governance structure (e.g. underwriting criteria, loss mitigation, collateral  
             management, collections policies, recovery process, residual setting policies, disaster recovery) employed by  
             the  Company  for  originating  and  servicing  the  equipment  is  an  important  credit  consideration  in  KBRA’s  
             analysis.  KBRA  typically  considers  the  impact,  if  any,  of  the  relative  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  
             transaction parties, which may lead to adjustments (positive or negative) in its base case assumptions. Please  
             refer to the section for additional information regarding the transaction parties and servicing of collateral.   
               
             Structure  

             Transaction structure is an important governance factor in structured finance transactions as many structural  
             aspects, such as adherence to representations and warranties, indemnification obligations in place, compliance  
             with origination standards and eligibility criteria and / or concentration limits, if applicable, reporting of collateral  
             performance, debt service and event-related triggers, and segregation and application of cashflows, require  
             parties to act in good faith and certify the accuracy of such  information. Failure to do so could impact actual  
             performance. KBRA considers the transaction structural features such as, but not limited to: cash management  
             arrangements;  operational  complexity  of  the  business;  reserve  requirements  for  upfront  and  ongoing  
             obligations; waterfall provisions; the bankruptcy remoteness of the Issuer; and underlying collateral for the  
             debt, as applicable, in the ratings analysis. KBRA considers these structural features, credit enhancement, and  
             transaction documents during the course of our credit analysis and ratings assignment process. Please refer to  
             the section for additional information regarding the structure.
